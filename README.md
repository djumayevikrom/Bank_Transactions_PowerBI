# Bank_Transactions_PowerBI
This project analyzes bank customer transactions using Power BI.
The dashboard provides visual insights into transaction patterns, customer spending behavior, cash flow movements, and category-based trends.
Key KPIs (such as total transaction amount, average transaction size, category contribution, and monthly trend changes) are calculated using DAX formulas.
